If you go away on this summer day

Then you might as well take the sun away

All the birds that flew in the summer sky

When our love was new

and our hearts were high

When the day was young

and the night was long

And the moon stood still

for the night bird's sang

If you go away

If you go away

---------------------


But if you stay I'll make you a day

Like no day has been or we'll be again

We'll sail the sun

we'll ride on the rain

We'll talk to the trees

we'll worship the wind

And if you go I'll understand

Leave me just enough love to hold in my hand

If you go away

If you go away

----------------------------


If you go away

As I'm the real must there'll be nothing left

In the world to trust just an empty room

Full of empty space like the empty look

I see on your face

I'll be the shadow of your shadow

I fell you might have kept me by your side

If you go away

If you go away
